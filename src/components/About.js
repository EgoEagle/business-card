               <p> I am a programmer, educator, artist, and game developer. I have a passion for game development and software development, it is what I do in my free time. I started programming in college and have found the subject to be one of the most relevant fields. I wish to one day be a part of a big project that many will talk about, whether it's a game or a life-changing application. </p>
